**Cross-repository work:** As soon as work is known to span more than one Git repository, invoke `$graphify` before further discovery, planning, or edits. Query a relevant existing graph first; build or update a merged graph if none exists, it is stale, or it does not cover every repository in scope. Reuse a current graph already produced for the same repository set.

Codex maintains a context (history of messages) that is sent to the model in inference requests.

1. No history rewrite - the context must be built up incrementally.
2. Avoid frequent changes to context that cause cache misses.
3. No unbounded items - everything injected in the model context must have a bounded size and a hard cap. 
4. No items larger than 10K tokens.
5. Highlight new individual items that can cross >1k tokens as P0. These need an additional manual review.
6. All injected fragments must be defined as structs in `core/context` and implement ContextualUserFragment trait
